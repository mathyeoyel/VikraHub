# Method 2: Static Site with _redirects

services:
  - type: static
    name: vikrahub-frontend
    buildCommand: |
      cd frontend
      npm ci
      npm run build
      # IMPORTANT: Don't copy _redirects manually, let React build handle it
    staticPublishPath: frontend/build
    envVars:
      - key: REACT_APP_API_URL
        value: https://vikrahub.onrender.com/api/

# _redirects file should be in public/ directory and contain:
/*    /index.html   200

# Key points:
# 1. Only use /* catch-all, not specific routes
# 2. File must be exactly named "_redirects" (no extension)
# 3. Must be in public/ directory to be copied to build/
# 4. No other routing configuration in render.yaml
