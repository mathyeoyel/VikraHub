    );
  }
  
  // Status and sorting logic...
};

const handleBulkAction = async (action) => {
  // Support for delete, publish, unpublish, feature actions

  // Automatic refresh after completion
};

const getContentStats = () => {
  const stats = {
    total: content.length,
    published: content.filter(item => getItemStatus(item) === 'Published').length,
    featured: content.filter(item => item.featured || item.is_featured).length,
