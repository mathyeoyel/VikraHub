# VikraHub Follow System - Final Status Check

## üéâ **Backend Status: ‚úÖ WORKING**
- Backend live at: https://api.vikrahub.com
- Follow endpoint responding: 401 (needs auth) ‚úÖ
- API receiving requests: ‚úÖ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Frontend Status: Still Checking**

### Current Issues from Browser Console:
- Still shows: `main.248fdd87.js` (old build)
- Still using: `vikrahub.onrender.com` (old API URL)
- Still getting: WebSocket errors to wrong URL
- Still missing: Follow API functions

### What This Means:
The **backend is ready** but the **frontend hasn't rebuilt** yet.

### ‚ùì **Questions for You:**

1. **What build file do you see now?**
   - Still `main.248fdd87.js`? 
   - Or a new hash like `main.abc123.js`?

2. **What API URL does the browser show?**
   - Still `vikrahub.onrender.com`?
   - Or now `api.vikrahub.com`?

3. **Are you still getting follow function errors?**
   - Still `getMyFollowStats is not a function`?
   - Or are those errors gone?

### üîß **Next Steps:**

**If still old build (`main.248fdd87.js`):**
- Frontend deployment platform might not be set up correctly
- We may need to manually trigger rebuild
- Check your deployment dashboard (Netlify/Vercel/etc.)

**If new build (different hash):**
- Try the follow button - it should work now!
- Clear browser cache completely
- Test follow functionality

### üéØ **The Good News:**
Backend is ready! Once frontend rebuilds with latest code, everything should work perfectly.

**Please check your browser console and let me know:**
- Build file name
- API URL being called
- Any follow function errors
